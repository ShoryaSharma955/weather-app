# weather-app
hi!
I have created a weather app using python language.
This app shows you current temperature, pressure, weather decription and weather climate of any city or state in the world.
While running the code, ensure that you have change the API KEY and URL in line 11.
To find your API KEY and URL, take help form Youtube.
